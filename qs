Macro & Policy-linked

“How are you thinking about the balance between sticky UK inflation and the BoE’s easing cycle — is the bigger driver now the domestic data or global long-end term premium?”

“Markets seem to think Reeves will need more than £10bn of fiscal headroom to calm gilts — how much does the Budget actually matter for 30y pricing, versus global rate dynamics?”

“When you look at the UK long end trading at multi-decade highs, how do you separate what’s fiscal risk premium versus just global term premium?”

📈 Curve & Flow Structure

“The long end has been heavy with 30y forwards above 6% — do you see that as more of a structural lack of demand, or short-term positioning into supply events?”

“What does the curve trade that tells you the most right now about investor sentiment — is it 5s30s, 10s30s, or front-end vs belly?”

“How do liability-driven investors and insurers feature in today’s market compared to pre-LDI crisis — are they still a big anchor for longs, or has that flow diminished permanently?”

🔄 Market Microstructure & Liquidity

“When the BoE sells long gilts in QT, what impact do you actually see on day-to-day liquidity and pricing?”

“How does liquidity in GBP swaps vs cash gilts compare right now, especially in the long end — which is the truer signal?”

“On auction days, do you watch relative value across the curve more closely, or is outright demand still the bigger driver of concession?”

🧩 Trading & Risk Management

“When the market is dominated by fiscal headlines, how do you risk-manage positions in the long end? Is it about outright, or do you prefer to express views via spreads and boxes?”

“How much of the GBP rates desk’s P&L tends to come from directional macro vs relative value vs flow facilitation?”

“In the current environment, what curve or spread trades do you think best capture the fiscal risk premium without taking a huge macro bet?”

🌍 Cross-Asset / Global Angle

“Bunds and Treasuries both feed into gilts — when you see a sell-off in US 30y, how do you judge whether gilts will outperform or underperform?”

“Do you think the UK’s fiscal credibility is now a more important differentiator for global investors than it was pre-mini-budget?”

🎯 Personal / Desk Insight

“When you look at interns and juniors on the desk, what impresses you most — is it quick grasp of macro drivers, or more ability to track and summarise flow dynamics?”

“What was the most surprising move in GBP rates this year that you think people underestimated?”

👉 Strategy:

Pick 3–4 of these that you’re genuinely interested in.

Start with a macro/fiscal one, then a curve/liquidity one, then a personal/desk insight one — that mix shows breadth.

Would you like me to also script one “starter” question you can use to kick off the chat casually (so it feels natural, not rehearsed)?




Macro/Fiscal

“When you see fiscal headlines hitting gilts, how do you decide whether the move is just noise or whether it should reprice the curve structurally?”
→ Shows you get that not every headline is equal; traders filter news.

“Do you think the UK curve is already pricing in a ‘fiscal risk premium’, or is it more about global term premium bleeding into gilts?”
→ Subtle distinction, forces him to weigh the balance.

Curve/Flows

“Post-LDI, do you think insurers and pension funds have permanently changed how they hedge duration, or is it just paused until yields stabilise?”
→ Smart because it links regulatory behaviour to market structure.

“When clients ask for duration, do they prefer swaps or cash right now, and what does that tell you about their confidence in liquidity?”
→ Goes straight into flow intelligence.

Liquidity/Execution

“Do you see more risk premia in gilts coming from outright supply, or from the uncertainty about who the marginal buyer is?”
→ Shows you know supply and demand imbalance is the key.

“How much do you trust market depth screens at the long end right now, versus what you see in actual risk transfer?”
→ This is a “trader-to-trader” question; it shows you know screens aren’t always reality.

Risk/Trading Process

“When volatility is low but fiscal uncertainty is high, do you prefer to express views with options or just stick to cash/spreads?”
→ Forces him to talk about risk structuring.

“What are the red flags that make you step back from a trade — is it positioning, client flow, or just price action?”
→ Smart because you’re asking about process discipline, not trade calls.

Cross-Market/Strategy

“When Treasuries sell off and gilts follow, how do you judge if gilts are under- or over-reacting relative to Bunds?”
→ Shows you’re thinking in relative value across markets.

“How much do you watch sterling FX as a confirmation or contradiction of moves in gilts?”
→ Clever because it links rates and FX (sterling weakness often tied to fiscal credibility).

Personal / Desk Culture

“What mistakes do you see interns and grads make when they first come on a rates desk?”
→ Forces him to give you pitfalls to avoid.

“In your career, what was the biggest fiscal event where you felt the market completely mispriced gilts?”
→ Opens him up to a storytelling moment — great rapport builder.





Risk & Trading

“When you size curve trades, how closely do you watch DV01 matching — do you ever deliberately leave residual duration on?”
→ Shows you know the difference between pure RV vs directional risk.

“When a new long gilt syndication comes, how do you gauge if the market has enough demand to absorb the extra duration supply?”
→ Clever because it connects issuance → flows → risk.

“Do you think the UK market has a structural shortage of duration buyers now that LDI demand is lower?”
→ Smart post-2022 question.

“How do you think about key rate duration when managing risk — do you bucket exposure by 2y, 5y, 10y, 30y, or just think in DV01 terms?”
→ Shows you know KRD is a thing, not just headline duration.

🌍 Macro & Flows

“How much does Treasury or Bund duration supply spill over into gilts? Do global investors manage UK exposure as part of a single duration bucket?”
→ Clever cross-market thinking.

“Do clients tend to demand outright duration, or are they more often looking for spread trades these days?”
→ Lets him talk about client behaviour.

📈 Strategy / Positioning

“When rates volatility is low but fiscal uncertainty is high, is it better to run outright duration risk or structure it in spreads?”
→ Clever because it links macro regime → risk expression.

“Do you see the market pricing enough term premium for all the extra duration the DMO is issuing, or is that still underpriced?”
→ Shows you get that duration supply = term premium.

🧠 Desk-ready summary (if he quizzes you)

Duration = sensitivity measure, DV01 is the money unit.

Long end = most duration, so issuance there is heavy.

LDI crisis = example of duration demand disappearing → yields exploded.

Duration is the language of risk on the desk.
