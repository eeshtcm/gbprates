Strategy: Pre-Auction ASW Box (10y – 2y)

Intuition

In the days before a 10y gilt auction, that sector tends to cheap­en on ASW (its ASW widens) relative to the front end as dealers and RV accounts create balance-sheet room and pre-hedge supply.

Express this relative move with a DV01-matched ASW box: long 10y ASW vs short 2y ASW into the auction; flatten (close) before the bid deadline or on result, depending on your variant.

Instruments

Cash gilts: on-the-run 10y and on-the-run 2y conventionals.

SONIA swaps of matching maturities to create asset-swap packages (ASW):

Long 10y ASW: buy 10y gilt + pay 10y SONIA fixed (receive float).

Short 2y ASW: short 2y gilt + receive 2y SONIA fixed (pay float).

Repo for cash leg; cleared SONIA swaps for swap leg.

The Box

Let ASW_10(t) and ASW_2(t) be par asset-swap spreads (bp).

Define the box spread:

In P&L space you must DV01-match notionals so your exposure is to ΔBOX, not the swap curve:

Trade Rules (baseline)

Event universe: all nominal 10y UK DMO auctions. (You can replicate for 5y with 5–2, 30y with 30–10, etc.)

Entry time: T-3 business days at London close (16:30) before the auction date T0.
(Variants you’ll test: T-5, T-4, T-2, T-1, intraday entry at 15:30, etc.)

Position: Long BOX (long 10y ASW vs short 2y ASW) DV01-matched.

Exit (pick one for backtest):

Pre-result: flatten at T0 09:30–09:55 (before 10:00 bidding deadline) to capture pre-auction concession only; or

On result: flatten at T0 ~10:10–10:30 on result print; or

Fade: hold into T+1 close to capture a first-day mean-reversion leg. (Test separately; don’t mix in the same strategy.)

Filters (recommended)

Skip events where major UK data or BoE is within the holding window (e.g., CPI, labour market, MPC).

Skip if the 10y is switch/syndication-driven in the same window, or if the on-the-run changes (rebucket risk).

Optional liquidity filter: require average bid-ask < X bp, repo specialness within band, or minimum futures volume if you proxy with Gilt future.

Sizing

Target risk per trade: choose a RiskUnit = £ DV01 you’re comfortable with (e.g., £50k/1bp box DV01).

Convert to notionals using the DV01-match above.

Optional dynamic sizing: scale by (expected concession / box vol) using a rolling σ of BOX moves.

Stops & Risk

Hard stop: if BOX moves against you by 1.0–1.5× the rolling 5-day BOX σ before exit, flatten.

Time stop: always flatten by your chosen exit timestamp regardless.

Track basis risks: repo specialness changes, cash-swap funding spread moves, and any CTD/roll if futures proxies are used.

Costs to include

Cash gilt bid-ask (bp of yield ≈ bp of ASW), swap fixed-leg bid-ask (≈0.1–0.2bp), brokerage/clearing, and repo carry for the window. For T-3→T0 this is small but non-zero. Use conservative slippage.

Backtest: step-by-step
1) Data you need (point-in-time)

Auction calendar: auction dates/times, line ISIN, type (nominal vs linker), size.

Gilts: daily (or intraday) par ASW spreads for on-the-run 10y and 2y (SONIA-based), plus bond DV01 per 100 and accrued.

Swaps: 2y & 10y SONIA par rates (for QA vs vendor ASW if you recompute).

Repo: GC and special rates for both lines (carry/slippage).

Control calendars: macro events (CPI, GDP, MPC, auctions in other buckets).

(If you can’t source ASW directly, you can compute par ASW from price/yield, swap rate and repo; but most desks use the vendor series to avoid model drift.)

2) Event study construction

For each 10y auction e:

Identify entry timestamp t_in(e) and exit timestamp t_out(e) (per your variant).

Compute BOX levels at both timestamps:

 is your 10y cash notional (e.g., £100mm), and costs include both legs.

Sign convention

You are long BOX. Profit when ASW10 widens vs ASW2 (ΔBOX > 0) into the auction.

3) Controls, filters, and variants

No-auction control: sample identical windows on non-auction weeks to check that edge is auction-related.

Cross-bucket leakage: if a 2y auction occurs inside your 10y test window, drop or flag the event.

Tenor variants: test 10–5 and 10–30 boxes for the same events; test anchor as an interpolated curve ASW (e.g., linear blend of 2y & 30y) to reduce anchor idiosyncrasy.

Window variants: T-5→T0, T-4→T-1, intraday (e.g., 15:30→09:45 T0).

Exit variants: pre-result vs on-result vs T+1 close. Keep them separate.

4) Statistics to report

Hit rate, avg bp move, bp t-stat of ΔBOX, per-trade P&L (after costs), Sharpe, max DD, ex-ante vs ex-post vol.

Subsamples: pre-2016 vs post-2016 (SONIA transition era), pre-/post-2022 LDI shock, by auction size quartile, by time-since-last-auction in bucket, by macro-quiet vs macro-noisy windows.

Robustness: bootstrap the event distribution (5k resamples) for CI on mean ΔBOX.

Attribution: decompose ΔBOX into ΔASW10 and ΔASW2 legs to confirm the move is from the auction bucket.

5) Implementation gotchas

Point-in-time on-the-run: freeze which ISIN is your 10y/2y at t_in(e) and do not let it roll inside the window.

ASW definition: stick to par ASW vs SONIA for both legs; mixing Z-spread / Libor legacy series will contaminate results.

Funding & specials: if the 10y goes special into supply, repo charges can bite; include a conservative per-day repo adjustment.

Holiday/calendar: use London business days and auction timestamps (DMO bidding normally closes at 10:00 London for gilts).

Transaction costs: stress test with 0.3–0.5bp per ASW leg each way; you’ll be surprised how much it matters at T-3 horizons.

Example parameter set you can present

Bucket: 10y nominal auctions (exclude linkers & syndications).

Box: ASW10 – ASW2, DV01-matched notionals.

Entry: T-3 close; Exit: T0 09:45 (pre-result).

Filters: exclude if CPI/MPC in window; exclude overlapping 2y auctions.

Sizing: aim £50k/1bp risk on the box; hard stop at -1.25σ of 20-day BOX vol.

Costs: 0.4bp round-trip per leg + repo carry.

How you’d actually put it on

Compute DV01s at entry; set notionals so N10×DV01_10 = N2×DV01_2.

Buy the 10y gilt and pay fixed 10y SONIA to lock ASW10.

Short the 2y gilt and receive fixed 2y SONIA to lock ASW2.

Flatten both ASW packages at your exit time. Track BOX move and costs.

Extensions (nice to test if you have time)

Size-aware signal: scale entry only when announced size is top-quartile for that bucket.

Curve-neutral “butterfly box”: replace the 2y anchor with a curve-fitted anchor (e.g., 
𝑤
1
w
1
	​

·ASW2 + 
𝑤
2
w
2
	​

·ASW30) chosen to minimize historical regression error for ASW10—removes anchor idio risk.

Post-auction fade: separate strategy: go short BOX on result to capture mean reversion T0→T+1/T+3.

Regime switch: only trade when current BOX z-score < 0 (already tight) so there’s room to widen; or the opposite if your sample says “cheap gets cheaper.”



About the strategy itself

Signal robustness – “One thing I’m wondering is: does the concession edge survive if I normalise by volatility or by auction size? Or is it just concentrated in a few big events?”
→ Shows you care about stability, not just average P&L.

Benchmark choice – “If instead of a 2y anchor I used a curve-fit benchmark, would that remove some of the noise from front-end policy moves? Which do you find more tradable in practice?”
→ Links your backtest directly to practical structuring.

Scaling – “Given the DV01 in 10y auctions is lumpy, how do you think about sizing this kind of box trade — absolute DV01 vs scaling by expected auction size?”
→ Connects to real risk budgeting.

About market dynamics

Auction demand shifts – “I tested only pre-auction periods, but in practice how much weight do you put on post-auction mean reversion trades?”
→ Opens discussion on trading both concession and fade.

LDI / structural flows – “The long-end cheapens earlier than the 10y. Do you think that’s structural (LDI balance-sheet prep) or regime-dependent?”
→ Shows you’re thinking about why the pattern exists.

Curve linkages – “If BoE policy reprices the 2y massively in the window, would you still trade a 10y–2y box, or would you prefer a curve-neutral butterfly anchor?”
→ Shows awareness of anchor risk.

About implementation

Execution costs – “My backtest uses vendor ASW mid-quotes. In practice, how wide are the bid-asks in boxes like 10y–2y around auctions? Would that kill a 0.3–0.5bp expected move?”
→ Pragmatic trading question — good for credibility.

Stop-loss design – “I experimented with a 1.25σ stop. Do you think of risk management on concession trades as volatility-based, or more as a hard limit per auction?”
→ Shows you’re thinking like risk-managers.

Cross-bucket correlation – “Have you seen concession trades in different buckets (5y vs 10y vs 30y) interact? Is there ever a risk of double-counting if you put them on together?”
→ Very insightful; links to portfolio view.

About desk perspective

Tradability vs research edge – “From your experience, which matters more for a concession strategy: statistical edge in the backtest, or how easily you can actually put size through in the market?”
→ Invites them to share trader intuition.
