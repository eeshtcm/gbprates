“How much of the current breakeven pricing do you think is a true reflection of inflation expectations versus being driven by liquidity and risk premia?”

“When the Fed/ECB/BOE emphasize inflation targets, do you find that policy signals matter more for real yield moves or for breakevens?”

“Do you think structural factors like energy transition or deglobalisation are changing how traders should think about long-term breakevens?”

🔧 Trading & Strategy

“How do you weigh the trade-off between breakeven trades versus real yield trades — is one generally more liquid or easier to risk manage?”

“When carry and seasonality point in the same direction, how aggressive would you size up a trade compared to when they conflict?”

“How do you decide between trading outright breakeven vs cross-market RV (e.g., EUR vs GBP breakevens)?”

🏦 Flow & Liquidity

“How much do client hedging flows (like corporates or pension funds) actually move breakevens day to day?”

“Do you see different client bases (e.g. US pensions vs European insurers) focusing on different tenors of inflation?”

“How do you manage liquidity when seasonal adjustments or index extensions create one-off demand?”

⚡ Curveballs to Stand Out

“Is there such a thing as a global inflation risk premium, or is each market too local (energy mix, index methodology, fiscal policy) to be comparable?”

“Do you think breakevens are becoming more of a macro hedge (like against stagflation) rather than a pure inflation expectation trade?”

“With the rise of green transition-linked issuance, do you see new linkers or structures emerging that will change how we trade inflation?”

👉 A couple of follow-up comments you can drop after they reply:

“That’s interesting — when I looked at breakevens recently, I noticed they were moving more with energy futures than with survey expectations. Does that align with how you think about them?”

“So essentially, even though breakevens are about inflation, they’re also reflecting things like liquidity and carry, not just macro expectations?”

“That makes sense — so client flows can create opportunities where breakevens don’t really reflect fundamentals, but more positioning imbalances?”

Do you want me to also prep a couple of questions that connect inflation trading back to linear rates? (That would make you sound like you’re tying your shadowing experiences together, which the desk heads will love.)

ask more specific technical questions - we also spoke about things like RPI, linkers, asset swap linkers, hedging risk

Perfect — if you already went into RPI, linkers, asset-swap linkers, and hedging, then the best way to follow up is with specific technical questions that traders themselves debate. These will show you’ve gone past the textbook level:

📊 RPI & Inflation Indices

“How much impact do you expect from the RPI–CPIH reform after 2030 on the linker market — is the effect already fully priced, or is there residual basis risk?”

“When you trade UK linkers, how much focus is on indexation lag mechanics versus outright breakeven levels?”

“Do you think the current inflation index methodologies (like RPI’s housing component) still distort valuations relative to true inflation?”

🔧 Linkers & Asset Swap Linkers

“When you trade asset-swap linkers, is the driver more about relative richness/cheapness to nominals, or about hedging client flows?”

“How do you think about linker ASWs compared to gilt ASWs — is liquidity the main differentiator, or are there structural pricing differences?”

“Do you find that linker ASWs trade more off credit/liquidity premia than macro fundamentals?”

🛡️ Hedging & Risk Management

“When managing a linker book, is the bigger risk breakeven volatility or real yield moves?”

“How do you typically hedge linker ASW risk — more with swaps or nominals?”

“Do you think inflation desks are inherently more exposed to liquidity squeezes, since the linker market is thinner than nominals?”

📈 Technical Curve/Carry

“Do you see the UK linker curve as systematically mispriced because of seasonality and carry flows, or is that arbitraged out quickly?”

“How do you balance holding a breakeven trade that looks attractive fundamentally but bleeds carry every day?”

“Do you treat short-end versus long-end linker breakevens as completely different beasts given the role of energy in the front end?”

⚡ To Really Stand Out

“Do you think there’s still alpha in cross-market breakeven trades — like GBP vs EUR linkers — once you adjust for different index methodologies and carry?”

“How do central bank QE or APF linker purchases distort breakeven valuations versus fundamentals?”

“If you could redesign the UK linker market — issuance structure, maturity distribution, or index methodology — what would you change?”

👉 A few ready follow-up comments you can use:

“So essentially, linker ASWs are almost a hybrid trade — part inflation view, part liquidity premium?”

“That makes sense — with RPI reform priced in, the challenge is less about the level and more about managing the residual basis risk.”

“Interesting — so breakevens are not just about inflation expectations, but also technicals like supply, liquidity, and carry.”
