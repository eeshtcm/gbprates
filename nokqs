Market & Macro

“How are you thinking about the balance between fiscal supply (gilts issuance, deficits) and monetary policy (QT, rate path) in driving the curve?”

“What’s your take on how structural buyers (e.g. LDI, insurers, overseas central banks) are influencing where the long end trades now versus pre-2022?”

“How do you see UK gilt market dynamics diverging from USTs and Bunds — are correlations breaking down, or is there still a global risk-free anchor?”

Desk Strategy & Risk

“How do you decide the risk allocation between directional duration risk vs relative value trades like ASW boxes or curve steepeners?”

“When running risk across maturities, is the focus more on key rate duration or on maintaining certain hedge ratios across benchmarks?”

“How much of the desk’s PnL comes from auction/concession dynamics versus broader macro trends?”

Trading Microstructure

“In practice, how do you manage liquidity risk in gilts compared to swaps, especially around events like DMO auctions or APF buybacks?”

“How has electronic trading and client flow data changed the way you think about pricing or positioning on the desk?”
 Big Picture & Career Insight

“What do you think distinguishes a strong linear rates trader today compared to 10–15 years ago? Has the skillset shifted more towards data and technology?”

“As co-head, how do you balance running a risk book with managing people and making strategic calls for the desk?”

“What’s the most useful lesson you learned early on in your trading career that you wish more juniors understood today?”

Curveballs to Stand Out

“Do you see structural shifts in the demand for duration (from demographics, pension reform, etc.) shaping the gilt curve over the next decade?”

“If you could redesign the gilt market microstructure — issuance, auctions, benchmark conventions — what would you change?”

“What risks do you think are most underpriced in rates markets right now?”

Tip: Don’t just ask — follow up with something that shows you’ve thought about it.
For example:
“On auctions, I was analysing concession recently and noticed that in the short end, supply shocks feed through differently than in the 10y sector. Do you think that’s structural, or just a function of recent BOE policy?”

That way you’re not just asking, you’re adding value to the conversation.

Do you want me to also draft 3–4 “ready-to-use” follow-up mini-comments (so you sound sharp after he answers), in case you get nervous and don’t know what to say back?

Perfect — here are ready-to-use follow-up mini-comments you can drop after he answers, so you sound thoughtful and engaged without forcing it. Each one is short, but shows you’ve connected his point to something broader:

1. On Macro & Supply

If he talks about gilt supply and auctions:
“That makes sense — it ties back to how the UK’s funding needs are structurally higher than pre-COVID, so I guess the market’s constantly recalibrating how much risk premium it demands for duration?”

2. On Liquidity / Microstructure

If he mentions liquidity differences between gilts and swaps:
 “Interesting — so is it fair to say that even though swaps are more liquid intraday, gilts still matter more for setting risk-free benchmarks because of the client base and issuance calendar?”

3. On Desk Strategy

If he explains risk allocation (directional vs RV):
“I see — so it’s almost like balancing a portfolio of bets, where some are about absolute rate moves and others are relative value to smooth the PnL profile?”

4. On Career / Skillset

If he talks about how trading has changed with data/tech:
“That’s really interesting — I’ve noticed a lot of interns and juniors gravitating towards coding and data work. Do you think that’s becoming as critical as market intuition now?”

These aren’t “new questions” — they’re smart bridges you can use to keep the conversation flowing while showing you’ve actually processed his answer. They also make it easier to pivot into a new area without awkward silence.

Would you like me to also prep you with a 30-second intro line you can use at the start of shadowing (something that shows who you are, your background, and why you’re excited to learn from him)?

You said:
he is the head of all linear rates trading - not just gbp
ChatGPT said:

Got it — that’s even bigger. Since he runs all of JPM’s global linear rates trading, the bar for your questions goes from UK-centric to global, cross-currency, and strategic. You’ll want to show you can zoom out beyond gilts and think about:

global supply/demand for duration,

cross-market relative value,

big structural themes (monetary policy divergence, regulation, client behaviour).

Here are upgraded questions that reflect his global mandate (and will make you stand out):

Global Macro & Policy

“How do you think about trading when the Fed, ECB, and BOE are all at different points in their cycles? Does divergence create more RV opportunities, or more risk to manage?”

“With fiscal supply elevated in the US, UK, and Europe, which market do you think is most at risk of a buyers’ strike?”

“Do you see the global rates complex still anchored by the US curve, or are local factors (like LDI in the UK, or JGB yield curve control in Japan) starting to dominate?”

Cross-Market & Strategy

“When you’re looking at relative value, do you think more in terms of cross-currency asset swap spreads, or curve shape divergences between markets?”

“How do you decide where to deploy risk across USD, EUR, and GBP when opportunities exist in all three?”

“Are cross-market basis trades still a meaningful source of PnL, or have regulatory and balance sheet costs squeezed that edge?”

Microstructure & Liquidity

“How has electronic trading in swaps and futures changed the way liquidity flows across global rates markets?”

“Do you see client flow data in one region (say, US pension demand) affecting how you position in another (like European long-end duration)?”

Structure & Risk Management

“As head of the whole linear rates franchise, how do you think about the balance between directional risk and providing liquidity to clients?”

“What’s the biggest risk to a global rates book that people outside the desk don’t usually appreciate?”

“How much of the desk’s risk is actually centralised and correlated versus siloed into regional books?”

Forward-Looking / Strategic

“Do you think the structural demand for safe assets (pensions, regulation, central banks) will continue to suppress term premia globally, or is that regime breaking?”

“If you had to bet on one rates market looking completely different 10 years from now, which would it be and why?”

“What risks do you think are systematically underpriced across global rates right now?”
